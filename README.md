### What is it
This is an audio receiver and amplifier with a classic design. I built it because I wanted to learn more about Class AB amplifier design and analog circuitry in general.

### Why use it
Class-D amplifiers, as used in receivers these days, offer lots of power, but the sound quality can be lacking.

Class-AB amplifiers, while less efficient and therefore harder to get high power output, have overall less distortion and can offer a better signal-to-noise ratio if designed properly.

The design of the amplifier portion is similar to amplifiers built in the so-called "Golden age" of Hi-fi audio, in the 70s and 80s. I wanted a Class-AB amplifier that had the great sound quality of products from times gone by, but with modern features such as digital screens, and without the clunky mechanical interfaces of older receivers.

### Features
 - Stereo audio amplifier
 - 4 input channels
 - Volume control
 - Digitally selectable inputs
 - OLED display with renamable inputs
 - 15w per channel output
 - All-analog signal path
 - 3 separate PCBs for low noise

### Usage
It is super simple, just hook up a line level signal to the RCA jacks on the back, and select your input and you're good to go!
